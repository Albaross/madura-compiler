<h1>Madura - why yet another programming language?</h1>
<p>
    Madura is the name of my pet programming language, my playground for experimenting with new technologies, my
    laboratory to try out new ideas. Madura is also the name of a tiny island near Java, which reflects the initial
    intention quite well: At first, Madura wasn't much more than a kind of Java dialect, my attempt to design a "better"
    Java.
    The first draft came from a time when Java 8 was the latest version, when I was already somewhat familiar with
    Spring Boot and Project Lombok and just before I got to know Kotlin. I do not recall every adjustment I had planned,
    but some of the major changes include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Compiler hooks can be implemented directly in the source code as part of the project.</li>
    <li>To make a class <em>abstract</em>, the bodies of some its method's bodies are omitted.</li>
    <li>Classes and methods are <em>public</em> by default, while attributes are <em>private</em>.</li>
    <li>The keyword <em>shared</em> is used instead of <em>static</em> and the type <em>none</em> instead of
        <em>void</em>.
    </li>
    <li>Method parameters are always <em>final</em>.</li>
    <li>Checked exceptions are removed.</li>
    <li>An optional array parameter in <em>main</em> method and a shorter <em>println</em> method.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Since
</p>

A short program might look like this:
<code>
    @Data
    class Person {
    final String name;
    }

    class Main {
    shared none main() {
    final Person person = new Person("Tom");
    println("Hello " + person.getName());
    }
    }
</code>
